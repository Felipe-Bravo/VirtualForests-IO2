### 1. Preparatory actions
### 2. Obtaining ground data
### 3. Importing remote sensing data from Earth Explorer

---------------------


### Preparatory actions
The first step is to define a working directory for your work. Normally, I have a folder in the root directory where I create inside a subfolder for each project.
You can use your own path and folder names. In this case my working directory will be C:\datosR\virtualforest_IO2
'''r
# establishing the working directory 
setwd("C:/datosR/virtualforest_IO2")
'''
Next we have to define the output options

### Obtaining ground data
We'll use data from the National Forest Inventory of Spain, 3rd edition. You can get detailed information at this paper by [Alberdi et al, 2021](https://pfb.cnpf.embrapa.br/pfb/index.php/pfb/article/view/1337/580) In the following two images (from Alberdi et al, 2021) you can outlook the NFI field methodology
